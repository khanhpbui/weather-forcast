Once the page is accessed, the user will be presented with the current date on the top.
On the bottom, the user will be presented with the timeblocks, space to add notes, and save buttons to save the notes.
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
The saved notes will be saved in local storage, so it will not disappear if the user refresh the page.
